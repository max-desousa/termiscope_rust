# Termiscope

A realtime grep tool for regular expression searching without repetitive running.

**DISCLAIMER** *This is a vibe-coded app with help from grok 4. When I first decided to learn Rust, this application was an idea that I had. I'm archiving it hear on github for others to have/build off of.*

## About
Have you ever worked in a complicated code base and been trying to grep for a string that you're a little fuzzy on? With today's tools probably not. I despise VS Code. Work only supports that as an IDE, so I use grep a lot at work. 

At home, I love neovim and telescope. Being able to dynamically change my search as I go. This tool is simply that but for the terminal (terminal + telescope = termiscope).

## Usage
Simply compile the master branch, add binary to your path as you see fit, run, and start typing your regular expressions.
